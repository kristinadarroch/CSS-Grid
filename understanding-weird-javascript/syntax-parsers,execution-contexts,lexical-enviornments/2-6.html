    <h1>Syntax Parsers, Execution Contexts, and
    Lexical Enviornments</h1>

    <h2>Syntax Parser:</h2>
    <p>A program that reads your code and determines what it does
    and if its grammer(syntax) is valid. - Your code isn't magic, someone
    else wrote a program to translate it for the computer</p>
    <p>Your code that is running your program isn't exactly what the computer
    is running, it is a translation of what you wrote. So there is probably
    "extra stuff" the compiler is running</p>
    <h2>Lexical Enviornment:</h2>
    <p>Where something sits physically in the code you write. - its syntax,
    vocabulary. - where you place different things in your program -
    the compiler cares about where you put things.</p>
    <p>'Lexical' means 'having to do with words or grammer'. A lexical
    enviorment exists in a programming language in which <strong>where</strong>
    you write something is <i>important.</i></p>
    <h2>Execution Context:</h2>
    <p>A wrapper to help manage the code that is running - contains things in
    your code but also can contain things beyond your code (the translation
    added stuff)</p>
    <p>There are lots of lexical enviorments. Which one is currently running
    is managed via execution contexts. It can contain things beyond what
    you've written in your code.</p>
